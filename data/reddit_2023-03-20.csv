I was playing some games on my iPhone and there are more and more games that provide free games with commercials and I thank you for all free games and your hard work, I will pay for the good ones, after I try them first.

I understand that developers need to earn money, I don't mind seeing adds in games, but please for the love of god, respect mute toggle or sound settings in game. There are quite a few games, that even if you physically mute the phone with mute toggle, the commercial in the game does not respect this.

jczbqpy,"That’s a false comparison because unlike desktop OS, smart phones as we know them today have always had this model of an application store. For almost 15 years, the App Store and Play Store have been the one-stop-shop for everyone to get exactly what they’re looking for on their respective platforms. It’s also what made these products so instantly popular and easy to use - you don’t need to go through an install wizard, you don’t need to go to the vendor’s website and pay, you don need a guide to explain how to find the installer in a specific folder and what other files are. It just works. That’s one of the reasons why people who are less tech-savvy feel comfortable using their phone over a computer.  
While Android was more liberal with this approach, the Play Store is still the most vibrant and popular application store on Android by a long shot.  
Taking away this one-stop-shop and breaking it out into competing application stores, each requiring the user to sign up and divulge different degrees of personal details and credit card info, each holding a different set of apps, is going to damage the simplicity that users currently experience with their phones and tablets. Most people don’t want their phone to be like a computer. Those who do - already use a computer.  
  
Why are entertainment devices not the same? Are you telling me it’s perfectly legit to demand Apple allow Microsoft to run Xbox games via cloud on an iPhone, which has a relatively small screen and relies on battery, but it’s not ok to demand Sony to allow the exact same thing on a proper gaming console with a controller? Why? If anything, it makes even more sense! Heck, I’d love to play Halo on my PS5, but Microsoft has no interest in that happening. Heck, they haven’t even properly developed an Xbox Cloud app for the Mac! Why insist on iOS? And if you use your phone for work all day every day, how much time are you really going to spend gaming on it…?  
  
People want to to “open up” the App Store because they don’t like Apple supposedly telling them what they can or can’t have.

I could jailbreak my phone, but on an old model (X and prior models) with last year’s iOS. It is not a viable option. Apple does not provide me the tools I need to customise MY phone to my likings, it also actively prevents me from doing it. The same goes with spare parts, I should be allowed to use a 3rd party screen without having my front camera soft-locked, as it has been reported numerous times. We should keep in mind that the right to have a private property and use it as we like is considered a major freedom, and is even written of the French Declaration of the Rights of Human and Citizen of 1789 (article 17), a text used in the french modern constitution for instance. What Apple and other companies are doing MAY be considered as a violation of this freedom.

Regarding how alternate app stores might steal your personal data, regulations could be put in place to prevent those issues. We all are supposed to read ToS. Regulators need to make sure the average consumer is able to read and understand those ToS. The european commision is working on this for instance. If consumer can read and understant ToS, they should be the one deciding if they want to use a service.

jczr4bh,"There’s a lot of nuance here and it’s hard because we’re not really comparing apples to apples (no pun).  No one is going to put the effort into developing an alternate app store on Android. Prices are lower on Android and developers make less money there. There’s also much less hate for Google compared to Apple, even though they charge developers the same cut.  
Meta especially. They’re hemorrhaging money, and lost a substantial income once Apple blocked tracking in iOS. They can already track and do whatever on Android, so they don’t really need Google’s permission to data-harvest. Setting up a competing app store would be their top priority. I can also see Elon Musk doing the same for Twitter and Tesla, because he has spite money. Not even talking about Chinese apps.  
Ideally, competition would be good, and in a perfect world it would turn out exactly how everyone on these threads think they would - devs get more money, innovation flourishes, more options for users… All nice and well, but reality and past experiences prove this is not the case because the big companies who only care about the bottom line won’t put the user first.

jd073k2,"> The Touch Bar would probably still be around if they didn’t completely replace the dedicated function row for it. 

As a developer, don't get me started on the TouchBar. 

Not only did we lose an entire row of keys while the glass touchpad grew to swallow up the allowance, but they also jogged _IN_ the virtual Escape key on that TouchBar, so it would aesthetically fit in with the TouchID/Power button on the right side, a _physical button_, to the right of the TouchBar. 

They could have had the TouchBar _and_ the physical row of keys below it, if they didn't increase that glass touchpad to be nearly the size of an iPad Mini below the keyboard. It's unnecessarily large for a tracking surface. 

As a developer, we're told we can just turn on the 'virtual' Fn row of keys, and get back to the way things were. Except we can't, because now the key alignment is off by a full key's width, and the virtual Esc key now sits up and to the left of the '1' key and is narrower, instead of aligned directly over the keys below it, as it is on _every other Mac keyboard in existence_. You can see a great example of it here: 

* https://creativepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FN-keys-default.png

You have to train your hand to hit the Esc key at a completely awkward, mid-key-placement location in order to use it. Absolutely ridiculous design, and shows it was just an afterthought, not intentionally placed.
