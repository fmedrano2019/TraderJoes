Then I felt fucked up and lonely, even though I was a big wide kid, I sat on the roof of our house and cried a lot, at that moment I thought my heart would just burst, it hurt a lot. I sat on the roof for a long time, but then when everyone was asleep I decided to suicide. I thought: Nothing will stop me, God himself wants me to do it. I had already hung the rope on the very last step of the stairs, made a loop and was about to leave for another world, but it turns out my older brother was \"calming\" himself that night and did not sleep, through the window he saw me hanging on the stairs without signs of life and how he screamed: What the fuck are you doing?

      "\n",
      "Also I found this on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) :\n",
      "German: Dutch. Standard Dutch and Standard German show a limited degree of mutual intelligibility when written. One study concerning written language concluded that Dutch speakers could translate 50.2% of the provided German words correctly, while the German test subjects were able to translate 41.9% of the Dutch equivalents correctly. Another study showed that while Dutch speakers could correctly translate 71% of German cognates, they could only translate 26.6% of non-cognates correctly, suggesting a widely fluctuating intelligibility. In terms of orthography, 22% of the vocabulary of Dutch and German is identical or near identical. The Levenshtein distance between written Dutch and German is 50.4% as opposed to 61.7% between English and Dutch. The spoken languages are much more difficult to understand for both. Studies show Dutch speakers have slightly less difficulty in understanding German speakers than vice versa. It remains unclear whether this asymmetry has to do with prior knowledge of the language (Dutch people are more exposed to German than vice versa), better knowledge of another related language (English) or any other non-linguistic reasons.\n",
      "4.12\n",
      "\t\tIn terms of comprehension, German is definitely one of the easiest languages for Dutch speakers to learn. That's only one aspect though. After only a few weeks of intensive study, German learners of Dutch can (not necessarily will) produce even somewhat complex Dutch sentences that are 100% grammatically correct. Many if not most Dutch learners of German never reach that level because they struggle with the case endings, which practically don't exist in Dutch. That's why it takes a lot more time and effort for Dutch speakers to produce correct German than the other way around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spanish, for instance, doesn't have the advantage of mutual intelligibility, but its grammar is relatively easy and you can produce grammatically correct sentences after a short period of studying. The number of different tenses in Spanish can be a bit daunting, but it's easy to avoid the ones you haven't mastered yet because they're not all required to form syntactically and pragmatically correct sentences. You can't really do that in German with the case endings because they're ubiquitous.\n",
